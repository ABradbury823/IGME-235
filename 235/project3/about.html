        <h2>High Concept:</h2>
        <p>A Reverse Tower Defense game where the player is attacking with waves of soldiers against an increasingly well-defended castle.</p>

        <h2>Genre:</h2>
        <p>Strategy, Resource-Manager</p>

        <h2>Platform:</h2>
        <p>Desktop only</p>

        <h2>Story:</h2>
        <p>
            You are in command of an army that has been fighting a long war, and the battles have gone in your favor. 
            You find yourself at the enemy's home castle, but it is heavily guarded. Its time to siege the castle! 
            Get your troops through the enemy's defenses, break down their walls, and earn a victory for your kingdom!
            You will get more powerful reinforcements as time passes, but beware, your enemy will have more advanced defenses as well!
        </p>

        <h2>Aesthetics:</h2>
        <p>
            This game will feature cartoonish graphics, since we don't want any 2D knights harmed in the making of this game!
            Sounds will include, but are not limited to: UI sounds for selecting troops, effect sounds for enemy towers.
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay:</h2>

        <h3>Mechanics:</h3>
        <p>
            Based on their progression, the player selects which forces they went to send out into the fray before the siege(level) starts. 
            Each troop costs a certain amount of gold to deploy. Gold can be earned slowly over time during a seige, from passing a 
            milstone on the track, or by destroying a barricade. Gold can also be used to upgrade troops in various ways, such as increasing
            movement speed, reducing damage taken from enemy towers, and other effects. However, the player must be careful with how they 
            spend their gold: if they start a siege with insufficient funds to deploy troops, they lose. <br>
            When the player has selected their troops, they can start the siege and see the outcome of their selection. When the siege begins the 
            player's pieces make their way along the track and are attacked by enemy towers. Troops that reach the end of the track
            begin attacking a barricade. When a barricade is destroyed, the player proceeds on to the next level of the siege, where enemy towers 
            are stronger and may have more abilities. 
        </p>

        <h3>Controls:</h3>
        <p>Keyboard and Mouse</p>

        <h3>Onboarding:</h3>
        <p>
            Players will be able to learn the basic mechanics in the first siege. Since the wave doesn't start until the player presses
            a start button, they can take as much time as needed to figure out UI and simple mechanics. This tutorial level could even have
            infinite gold and/or a straight, lowly defended track so they can have a safe place to make mistakes early on. 
        </p>

        <h3>Player Learning:</h3>
        <p>
            Players will have to learn how to use their gold carefully. Making decisions about which troops to deploy could determine the 
            a later success or failure. If time allows, there will be multiple types of troops to deploy, and multiple enemy towers to 
            encounter, all of which the player will need to learn the strengths and weaknesses of in order to plan their strategy most effectively.

        <h2>About the Developer:</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Andrew Bradbury. I am a third year Game Design & Development major and Japanese minor at the Rochester
            Institute of Technology. I usually prefer to stick to coding in C# and C++ in game projects, but I also enjoy
            dabbling in 3D modeling in Maya if given the chance. As of writing this, this is my first semester of using HTML, 
            CSS, and JavaScript to make interactive webpages and so far I have been enjoying it quite a bit. When I'm not 
            staring at blocks of code for schoolwork or other projects, I enjoy playing <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> with my friends.
            I'm even running a couple campaigns of my own, something about creating a world and having other people play through
            it and enjoy it is particularly thrilling for me.
