                    <i>Lucid</i> was made as part of a 48-hour game jam in December 2020 using the Unity game engine. <i>Lucid</i> 
                    is a puzzle platformer game where the player can summon in boxes to help them solve various puzzles. I was 
                    mostly involved with the player's movement script, sound effects, and particle systems. My largest contribution
                    to the game was assisting my teammates with learning Unity, C#, and GitHub version control.

                    <i>Siege the Castle</i> is a web browser game I made as the final for my Intro to Game Web Tech class in May 2021.
                    The game uses the PixiJS JavaScript library to render graphics to the screen and ES6 classes to represent in-game 
                    objects. <i>Siege the Castle</i> is a "reverse tower defense" game, in the sense that instead of placing down towers
                    to defend against waves of ballons, zombies, etc., the player is the one sending troops down the track in order to 
                    reach the end and as the name suggests, siege the castle.

                I am a Gameplay Programmer located in Rochester, New York. I currently attend the Rochester Institute of Technology,
                majoring in Game Design and Development. When I'm not doing coursework or working on my most recent project, I am 
                frequently practicing my Japanese reading, writing, and speaking ability. My two passions, game-making and Japanese,
                were formed back in my childhood when I played tons of video games and watched plenty of anime. I was always curious
                what went into making games and was fascinated by how the hardwork of a team of people culminated in the creation of my
                favorite games.
