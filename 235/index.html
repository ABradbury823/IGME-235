            <p class="textbox">
                Hello there and welcome to the webpage for my web development class! My name is Andrew Bradbury. 
                I'm a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, majoring in Game Design & Development and <em>(hopefully)</em> minoring in Japanese.
                Outside of school, my interests involve playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, watching anime and playing video games.
                I hope that I can get enough skills in this class to make a proper portfolio in order to impress future employers.
                My goal for the future is to land a job at a game company as a software engineer, making games with engines like Unity and Unreal.
                When I graduate, I aim to live in Japan, either working remotely at a game company in the United States or locally in Japan.
            </p>
